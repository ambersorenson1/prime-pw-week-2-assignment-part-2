// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We declared the variable name as Dane. If the name is equal to Mary exactly then it will console log Hi, Mary!

// if not then it will console log How do you do?
//
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//  We delcared the variable as secret we also declared the code as 123 if the code is equal to 123 exactly
// then secret will now become super and the code will change to * 2. The second if should be changed to
//else if the code is greater than 250 then secret will now become duper and it will console log secret.
//

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We declared isStudent to true. We also declared age to equal 34. We declared zip to 55407
//So if isStudent is equal to true exactly and zip is greater than 80000 then we will console log 'You're a
// student on the West Coast' otherwise if isStudent is equal to false exactly or the age is less than
// 30 then we console log 'What are your hobbies?' or else if isStudent is equal to true exactly
then we console log ' Welcome to Prime' or else if none of the other conditions are met then we console
log 'How about the weather?'
//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true

// can change only colorOne to purple

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'
// its supposed to say or because of the "||" and it should say that the temp is less than 39 setTimeout(function () {

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
